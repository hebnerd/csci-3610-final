The goal of this final project for a secure programming course was to fix several security issues on an already existing Java-based web server, including XXS and SQL injection vulnerabilities.

After finding issues with the application by performing both brute-force testing and using tools like OWASP ZAP, different fixes, such as using parameterized queries, were implemented, until no more vulnerabilities could be found.

Finally, unit tests for certain parts of the application were added as a bonus.
